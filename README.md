# Agung Kurniawan

Backend Engineer • B.Sc. Informatics Engineering • Indonesia  
Building scalable backend systems • AI/LLM integrations • IoT experiments

## Quick facts
- I like building **backend services** that stay maintainable as they grow
- I’m interested in **AI/LLM integrations** that solve real product problems
- I enjoy **IoT prototyping** (software + hardware)

## About
I enjoy designing services that are simple to operate, easy to evolve, and safe to scale.

- Backend & microservices (API design, reliability, performance)
- AI/ML explorations (LLM integrations, tooling, experimentation)
- IoT tinkering (Raspberry Pi, sensors, embedded prototypes)

## What I focus on
- **Architecture:** clean boundaries, modular services, pragmatic patterns
- **APIs & integrations:** REST, async messaging, third‑party integrations
- **Reliability:** observability, graceful degradation, on-call friendly design
- **Delivery:** maintainable codebases, automation, documentation that stays useful
